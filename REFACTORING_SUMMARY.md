# Token Purchase Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The original `token-purchase-new.tsx` file (1,825 lines) has been successfully refactored into smaller, more manageable components. This refactoring improves maintainability, readability, and reusability.

## File Structure

### Constants & Configuration
- `lib/constants.ts` - Contract ABIs, addresses, network configs
- `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `lib/currency-config.tsx` - Currency configuration with icons
- `lib/token-purchase-utils.ts` - Utility functions for calculations and conversions

### Custom Hooks
- `hooks/use-contract-data.ts` - Contract data fetching and state management
- `hooks/use-token-approval.ts` - Token approval logic and state
- `hooks/use-transaction-confirmation.ts` - Transaction confirmation handling

### UI Components
- `components/token-purchase/ProgressBar.tsx` - Sale progress display
- `components/token-purchase/CurrencySelector.tsx` - Currency selection buttons
- `components/token-purchase/AmountInput.tsx` - Amount input field
- `components/token-purchase/NwisAmountInput.tsx` - NWIS amount input field
- `components/token-purchase/PurchaseButton.tsx` - Main purchase button
- `components/token-purchase/NetworkWarning.tsx` - Network warning display

### Dialog Components
- `components/token-purchase/dialogs/NetworkSwitchDialog.tsx` - Network switching dialog
- `components/token-purchase/dialogs/TransactionConfirmationDialog.tsx` - Transaction confirmation
- `components/token-purchase/dialogs/TokenPurchaseAgreementDialog.tsx` - TPA dialog

### Main Component
- `components/token-purchase/TokenPurchaseNew.tsx` - Clean orchestration component (reduced from 1,825 to ~400 lines)
- `components/token-purchase/index.ts` - Export index for easy imports

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and fix bugs
- Simpler to add new features

### 2. **Readability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better code organization

### 3. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Hooks can be shared across different components
- Utility functions are centralized

### 4. **Testing**
- Individual components can be unit tested
- Hooks can be tested in isolation
- Easier to mock dependencies

### 5. **Performance**
- Smaller bundle sizes for individual components
- Better tree-shaking opportunities
- Lazy loading possibilities

## Migration Notes

### Original File
- **Location**: `token-purchase-new.tsx` (backup: `token-purchase-new-backup.tsx`)
- **Size**: 1,825 lines
- **Complexity**: High - multiple responsibilities mixed together

### New Structure
- **Main Component**: `components/token-purchase/TokenPurchaseNew.tsx` (~400 lines)
- **Total Files**: 15+ smaller, focused files
- **Average File Size**: ~50-100 lines per component

### Import Changes
The main component now imports from the new structure:
```typescript
// Old imports (all in one file)
// ... 1,800+ lines of mixed code

// New imports (clean separation)
import { ProgressBar } from "./ProgressBar"
import { CurrencySelector } from "./CurrencySelector"
// ... other focused imports
```

## Usage
The refactored component maintains the same API and functionality as the original:
```typescript
import TokenPurchaseNew from './token-purchase-new'

// Same props interface
<TokenPurchaseNew 
  currentPrice="$0.0010"
  amountRaised="$0"
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the refactored components thoroughly
2. Update any other files that import from the original component
3. Consider further optimizations based on usage patterns
4. Add unit tests for individual components

## Files Created
- 4 library files (constants, types, utils, config)
- 3 custom hooks
- 6 UI components
- 3 dialog components
- 1 main orchestration component
- 1 index file for exports
- 1 refactoring summary document

Total: **19 new files** replacing 1 large file
